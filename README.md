## What is the PG Number?

*Inspired by the [Erd≈ës Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number), the PG Number is a measure of how many degrees of separation there are between a person and Paul Graham.*

An edge on the PG Number graph can be any work of collaboration between two individuals. This includes:
- Essays
- Academic Publications
